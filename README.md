# liri-node-app

This is a CLI node app that takes input on the command line, and outputs data from the spotify api, the bands in town api, or the omdb api depending on whether you type in "concert-this" followed by the artist/band name, "movie-this" followed by movie title, or "spotify-this-song" followed by the song title.
